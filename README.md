# Indicator
A simple indicator for caps, num and scroll locks and hard drive activity that displays an icon in the system tray.

# Usage
Download the [latest release](https://github.com/Ben-H1/Indicator/releases/) and unzip it to a directory of your choice.
Run Indicator.exe to run the program.
`config.txt` can be updated manually, but the program automatically updates it to use the most recent settings.

If you want to update `config.txt` manually, each line of the file can be changed as follows:
1. Default: "1" - Caps lock indicator
2. Default: "1" - Num lock indicator
3. Default: "1" - Scroll lock indicator
4. Default: "1" - Hard drive activity indicator
5. Default: "100" - Time between each poll in milliseconds
